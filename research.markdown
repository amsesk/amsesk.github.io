## Ecology and evolution of obligate Burkholderia-related endohyphal bacteria (BRE)

Fungi are members of complex natural systems, within which their interactions with other living components of these systems (i.e., symbioses) can play pivotal roles in global patterns of nutrient cycling (e.g., mycorrhizae). The stable, symbiotic colonization of fungal cells by bacteria (i.e., endosymbiotic bacteria) is becoming increasingly recognized in nature, although the implications and histories of these systems remain poorly understood. Our work here generates genome-scale data for pairs of symbiotic partners, the current paucity of which corresponds with the relative novelty of this type of symbiosis to science. With increased sampling in genomic contexts, we can better understand the entangled evolutionary trajectories along which partners coevolve, how novel pairs of partners arise and stabilize over deep time scales, and the functional implications of harboring endosymbiotic bacteria with respect to the host.

## Genome-scale phylogenetics of enigmatic early-diverging fungi

Most fungi are uncultured, meaning that they have not, and possibly cannot, be isolated in pure laboratory cultures. This simple reality severely complicates biological research in these areas of the fungal tree of life, obscuring their forms, functions, and evolutionary histories. My dissertation research uses single-cell genomics (SCG) to circumvent this central obstacle, sequencing the genomes of uncultured fungi collected as individual cells directly from nature. Genome-scale data in hand, we can resolve blurry areas of the tree of life and characterize the life histories of these dark matter fungi in a genetic context.
